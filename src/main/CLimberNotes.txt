New Auto Assisted CLimber
=========================

Climbing Steps for Fast, Swing Free Climb:

1. Driver pilot drives to position to engage first bar.

2. Climber pilot Rasise TE arms with TE-UP Button.
   (This can be down while robot gets into position)

3. Pilots work together to engage bar with TE.  Use
   TE-UP and TE-DOWN buttons to engage TE hooks.  
   This is all manual. 

4. Climber pilot manually uses TE-DOWN to get
   the robot to raise off the floor and be suppended
   by the first bar.

5. Once the robot is off the floor, the Climber
   pilot presses FIN-CLIMB (Y) to finish the
   climb to the first bar.  (This runs C-Auto-1)
   This part of the climb is finished when:
     a. The SW hooks are completely engaged
        on the bar. The TE hooks will be
        either engaged or slightly raised off
        the bar.
     b. A green light on the Shuffle board
        is displayed.

6. Upon seeing a finished climb to the first
   bar, the climber pilot presses NXT-CLIMB (X)
   (C-Auto-2 Runs).
   THis causes the robot to:
        a. Swing out 
        b. Extend the TE Hooks.
        c. Swing in.
        d. Retract the TE Hooks.
        e. Swing out while the TE and the
           SW Hooks are engaged.  THis is
           the most percise move the auto 
           routine needs to make.
        f. Continue to Retract the TE hooks
        for a few inches after "e".

7.  Upon seeing the sequence in 6 stop with
a green light. And if the robot is either engaged 
or not, and if not, not swinging, then the climber
pilot presses FIN-CLIMB (Y) to complete the climb
to the bar.

8. Steps 6 and 7 are repeated to climb to the
highest bar.

9. At any point during the auto sequences,
the climber pilot can press either bumper
switch to e-stop the squence, and then
take over manually.




   extend, then the robot swings in, then
   the TE hooks retrack. As the TE hooks
   retrack, the swings out to keep tension
   on the lower bar.  
   This sequence stops before the SW arms
   can engage the upper bar.  However, the
   robot may still be engaged on both bars
   or be completely hanging on the upper bar.



7. Upon seeing the robot connected to
both bars, and a green light to see
   


   bar.
